      Howdy! I'm a map lover from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Currently, I'm in my final semester at The George 
        Washington University studying Geography, GIS, and 
        Political Science. After graduation I will be staying in DC and working as an Associate
        GIS Analyst at Blue Raster, working with geospatial data to create 
        interactive mapping applications for non-profit organizations and 
        civilian government agencies. My passions include cartography, urban 
        transportation, Indigenous rights, and curbside management. I have
        a breadth of experiences working in various coding languages, geospatial
        analysis softwares, and graphic design programs. Basically, I'm the kind
        of nerd who both codes her own website and makes sure it has nice
        fonts.  When I'm not clacking around in ArcGIS Pro or VSCode you can find
        me knitting a sweater, eating a bagel sandwich (everything with lox), or 
        seeing a movie in a mostly empty theater. 
        Click around to see more of what I've done!
