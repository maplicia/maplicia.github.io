        <p>Alicia is a cartographer and geospatial developer based in DC and Minneapolis. 
	Having recently(ish) graduated from The George Washington University
        with a degree in Political Science, Geography, and Geographic Information Systems, Alicia is
        now a full time GIS analyst at Blue Raster, making cool maps for clients in state and 
	local government and at arboreta. She has a breadth of experiences working in various 
	coding languages, geospatial analysis softwares, and graphic design programs. 
	Basically, she's the kind of nerd who both codes her own website and makes sure it has nice
        fonts.  When not clacking around in ArcGIS Pro or VSCode you can find
        her knitting a sweater, eating a bagel sandwich (everything with lox), or 
        hanging out with her cat, Gaga. </p>
