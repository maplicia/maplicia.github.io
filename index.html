        <p>Howdy! Alicia is a cartographer and geospatial developer based in DC and Minneapolis. 
        Her passions include cartography, urban transportation, Indigenous rights, and 
        curbside management. Having recently graduated from The George Washington University
        with a degree in political science, geography, and geographic information systems, Alicia is
        now a full time GIS analyst and developer for local governments and public gardens.
        She has a breadth of experiences working in various coding languages, geospatial
        analysis softwares, and graphic design programs. Basically, she's the kind
        of nerd who both codes her own website and makes sure it has nice
        fonts.  When not clacking around in ArcGIS Pro or VSCode you can find
        Alicia knitting a sweater, eating a bagel sandwich (everything with lox), or 
        trying to perfect her home barista setup. </p>
